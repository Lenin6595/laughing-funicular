Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews Using Data Mining Techniques
 
The technique of data mining will be applied for the classification of movie reviews into positive and negative classes,
a tremendously important task to be done to improve recommendation systems with insights into audience preferences. 
It supplements a dataset of 51,000 movie reviews from outside sources, carrying out detailed preprocessing and thorough analysis. 
TF-IDF vectorization: This is a process through which the textual data is changed into numerical features that a machine learning model can work with. 
Training was done via a Random Forest classifier, which gave an accuracy of 80.12% on a hold-out test set of 3,300 samples after optimizations and rigorous tests. 
Python was chosen for data cleaning, feature processing, model construction, and performances. Future studies will be done by increasing the size of data and 
probably exploring other machine learning techniques that could result in better classification outcomes, including state-of-the-art methods such as ensemble 
and deep learning architectures for robust classification results.
